title: Donate to Ely Repair Cafe
draft: false

introduction: |
  Ely Repair Cafe is run by volunteers. There is no charge for people a volunteer repairer to try to fix someone's broken item. That means we're completely reliant on donations from people--like you--who want to support this cause, giving items a second life and reducing the need to send more waste to landfill.
