We had another great event at Ely Library in May. We welcomed some new repairers and saw some new and familiar faces with broken items that needed a bit of help.

35 people came with broken items and we were able to fix 22 of those on the day. Nine of the remaining items can be fixed but we either needed additional spare parts, or there wasn't time on the day. We've had bookings from some of those people already so hopefully we will see them at the event at Ely Cathedral on 27 July. Only three were completely broken and could not be fixed.

A total of 61kg of waste was prevented, and 266kg of extra COâ‚‚ emissions were avoided.

Here is a selection of the feedback received from repairees on the day
> Great, friendly, super atmosphere, I learnt a lot about tricks for repairing clothes.

> Very good repair, two issues with my hedge trimmer, Peter was very helpful. A job very well done. Should work for a few more seasons of hedge trimming.

> I'm very happy to have the life of my much used and much loved lamp.

> More difficult than I envisioned, but the repairer stuck with it and sorted it all beautifully, very pleased.

> It was a birthday present for my 40th and has been with me for 21 years.

> Very interesting, polite and professional, Mike tried until he found the faults and salvation.

> Excellent, Pete diagnosed the problem and immediately fixed the radio.
